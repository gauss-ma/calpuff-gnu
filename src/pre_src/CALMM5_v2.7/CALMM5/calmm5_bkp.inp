Note:
  A. CALMM5 output format options are (select one only): 
     1. MM5.DAT, 2: MM4.DAT (ASCII), 3: GrADS, 4: VIS5D, 5: NetCDF.
  B. The first line is title line.
  C. Contents after "!" are comments. At least one blank space is needed before it.
  D. Lines above "Keep this line..." are needed for all four available
     formats. 
  E. The lines below "Keep this line..." depend on the selected output format:
     i) For the output option 1 (MM5.DAT), five integers (0/1) in one line are needed,
        which determine to output or not for five variables in MM5. The five 
        variables are:
        1: W (vertical velocity), 2: humidity, 3: cloud and rain, 
        4: ice and snow, 5: graupel.
     ii) For the output option 2 (MM4.DAT), nothing more is needed
     iii) For the output option 3 (GrADS), see the following sample for more input
          lines. Note that the variable names must be the same as those used 
          in MM5 output. Use absolute path for output file name since GrADS 
          doesn't like relative path if the data file is not in the same 
          directory as GrADS. 
     iv) For the output option 4 (VIS5D), see the following sample for more input 
         lines. These lines are very similar to GrADS input lines
     v) For the output option 5 (NetCDF), see the following sample for more input 
         lines. These lines are very similar to GrADS input lines
